# retrohandheldtool

## What is this?

A work in progress tool for deciding on which retro gaming handheld to buy. It takes its data from a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1irg60f9qsZOkhp0cwOU7Cy4rJQeyusEUzTNQzhoTYTU).

## Tools and Languages used

I work with Vue and Nuxt. For styling I'm using Tailwind CSS

## Is it finished?

No it's not and it is only worked on sporadically. Often the google source table changes and I have to adapt the tool. Also not all information is shown and can be used as a filter

## Can I use the tool?

Sure but be warned that it is very much work in progress still: [retrohandheldtool](https://master--cocky-swirles-598238.netlify.app/)

# retrohandheldtool

## What is this?

A work in progress tool for deciding on which retro handheld to buy. It takes it data from a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1irg60f9qsZOkhp0cwOU7Cy4rJQeyusEUzTNQzhoTYTU).

## Tools and Languages used

I work on the tool with Vue and Nuxt so it's mostly JavaScript and HTML. For styling I'm using Tailwind CSS

## Is it finished?

No it's not and it is only worked on sporadically. Often the source table changes and I have to adapt the tool. Also not all information is shown and can be used as a filter
